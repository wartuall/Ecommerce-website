In the era of digital information,
the proliferation of fake news has become a
significant societal challenge, impacting public
opinion, trust, and democratic processes. This project
presents a rigorous investigation into the realm of
fake news detection using advanced machine learning
techniques. The primary objectiveis to develop a
robust and efficient system capable of discerning
between genuine and fabricated news articles,
thereby mitigating the harmful effects of
misinformation. The project delves into the ethical
considerations surrounding fake news detection,
addressing issues related to biases, fairness, and
transparency. Ethical guidelines and best practices
are integrated into the development process to ensure
responsible deployment of the detection system.
